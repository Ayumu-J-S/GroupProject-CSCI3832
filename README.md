# UnityGame-Gravitron
This is a 2D platformer game created with Unity by <a href="https://github.com/Turismo99">Turismo99</a>, <a href="https://github.com/bwright-01">bwright-01</a>, and myself in  CSCI3832(Game Design and Development).

## About the game
The game is a 2D puzzle-platformer that follows the adventure of Dr. Gravitron as he tries to save his dog Atom from the clutches of the evil Dr. Wretched. The player must use Gravitron’s anti-gravity inventions, the anti-gravity boots and anti gravity gun, as well as their own wits to get through each room of Wretched’s lab.
